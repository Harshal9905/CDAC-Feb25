    <h3><b>Sample paragraph:</b></h3>
    <p id="para">
        It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a disciplined life, 
        they set an easy path to success. They will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future ahead. 
        Being disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual 
        and hard-working. An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young. 
        Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life make it a worthwhile endeavour.
